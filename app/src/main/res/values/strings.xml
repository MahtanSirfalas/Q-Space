    <string name="info_how_to">
        \"How can i see the comments or write one to the stages?\"\n
        - In every stage there is a button on the right bottom. But you have to find the right answer or give up from the points to see them.\n
        \n\n
        \"How to upvote a comment?\"\n
        - By long pressing(touching) to the specific comment. Just a note you can\'t upvote your own comment\n
        \n\n
        \"How to undo my upvote?\"\n
        - Same with upvoting; by long pressing(touching) to the comment that upvoted before. (Green number at the bottom right corner of the comment means you upvoted the comment before)\n
        \n\n
        \"How to see another player\'s profile summary?\"\n
        - Double pressing(touching) to the comment will pop up a window that contains the summary of the player.\n
        \n\n
        \"How to delete my comment?\"\n
        - By long pressing(touching) to your own comment.\n
        \n\n
        \"How to edit my comment?\"\n
        - If you wrote a comment to any stage\'s comment page but didn\'t leave the current page, writing a new comment will replace your last comment. But if you left that page before you can\'t edit your comment.\n
        \n\n
        \"Why should i comment?\"\n
        - If your comment gets an upvote you will gain some points.\n
        \n\n
        \"Is the game ok for kids?\"\n
        - Sure, therefore; we didn\'t add P.M. and subcomment functions to the game?\n
        \n\n
        \"What is that ufo in the main menu?\"\n
        - Ask yourself!\n
        \n\n
        \"How may i know if my question suggest reviewed?\"\n
        - You will see an empty text area when you opened the "Suggest_Q" page.\n
        \n\n
        \"When will you add my suggested question?\"\n
        - If it is approved, it would be added to the queue. So it will be published when it is time.\n
        \n\n
        \"How may i know if it\'s approved?\"\n
        - We will mail you to inform.\n
        \n\n
